user_description: In the last ten years I have worked as a Business Intelligence consultant for companies in different sectors of activity (healthcare, hotels, beverage bottler, footwear manufacturing, legal assistance services). Some time ago, I decided to give my career a boost by delving into analytical skills. I discovered the potential of data analysis-oriented programming languages (R & Python) and the great possibilities of using machine learning techniques
